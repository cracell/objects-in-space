Simple Game in Rust using Piston

Currently a work in progress.

End Goal is a 2d game where you spawn in a procedurally generated spaceship. There are three doors each with a unique characteristic. And a procedurally generated riddle appears on the screen. You follow the riddle to enter the correct door and you either progress or are vented into space
